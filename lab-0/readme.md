##Python
###Advantages
- Clean and straightforward syntax (easy to read).
- No memory management.
- Supports dynamic type binding. In other words, an object is rarely only one instance of a class, it can be dynamically changed at runtime.
- Python has no primitives, everything including the builtin types (int, float, etc.) are objects;

###Disadvantages
- Data and methods hiding. It doesnâ€™t have the keywords of `private`, `public` and `protected` to better support encapsulation.
- Slow.
- Interpreted language.


##C++
###Advantages
- Better performance.
- Portable language (writing a program irrespective of operating system as well as hardware).
- Low level programming language.

###Disadvantages
- Requires a better aptitude to programming, and is more technically demanding than other programming languages.
- Manual memory management.
- Pointers :).
- Not pure OO programming language.
